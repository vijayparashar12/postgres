# This is forked from offical repo for using on mac.

 Due to the [limitation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#known-limitations-use-cases-and-workarounds) of Dcoker for Mac, host cannot directly connect to docker contaier.

# work around

 Host can only connect to container if binds itself to 0.0.0.0 network interface

I have only changed in 9.6 version so please try to use that.
